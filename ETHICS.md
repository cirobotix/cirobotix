# Cirobotix Ethics Guidelines

This document outlines the ethical principles guiding the development and use of Cirobotix technologies.  
It supplements the **Cirobotix Ethical License (CEL-1.0)** and is intended as a human-readable explanation of the values and boundaries behind this project.

## 1. Vision & Values

**Cirobotix** exists to make advanced automation, code generation, and research tools accessible to everyone.  
Our goal is to **empower engineers, researchers, and creators** — not to control, exploit, or harm.

Cirobotix is founded on three core principles:

- **Transparency** – every process, decision, and result should be traceable and understandable.  
- **Autonomy** – tools must strengthen individual and collective independence, never reduce it.  
- **Human-centric innovation** – technology should enhance creativity, freedom, and well-being.

---

## 2. Allowed Uses

Cirobotix software and frameworks may be used for purposes that align with open knowledge, education, and human progress, such as:

- Developing tools that **accelerate research**, **education**, and **scientific reproducibility**.  
- Automation frameworks that **reduce repetitive work** and **improve quality assurance**.  
- AI integrations for **ethical decision support**, **testing**, or **creative experimentation**.  
- Open-source contributions that **advance fairness, sustainability, or accessibility**.  
- Internal enterprise tools that **respect user privacy** and support informed human oversight.

## 3. Prohibited Uses

Cirobotix software **must not** be used for systems, products, or services that:

- Develop or operate **weapon systems**, combat drones, or military intelligence platforms.  
- Build or enhance **surveillance systems** that track, profile, or monitor individuals without consent.  
- Implement or facilitate **social or financial scoring** systems — any mechanism that ranks, evaluates, or penalizes individuals or groups based on behavior, economic status, or personal data.  
- Conduct **behavioral manipulation**, disinformation, or psychological exploitation.  
- Enable **algorithmic discrimination**, **mass data collection**, or **unauthorized profiling**.  
- Support projects that intentionally or systematically **violate human rights**, **privacy**, or **environmental integrity**.  
- Promote hate, repression, or inequality in any form.

These examples are non-exhaustive. When in doubt, interpret the license in favor of human dignity and autonomy.
